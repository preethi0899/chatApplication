# chatApplication
This is a chat application where multiple users can chat in the application server. The project is implemented using python(https://www.python.org/downloads/).

There are two files created, server.py and client.py. 
The socket programming  allows the  server to connect to multiple clients, where each of the clients communicate to the other client via the server of the same port.
